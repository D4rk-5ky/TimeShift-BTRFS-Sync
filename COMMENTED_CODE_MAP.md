# Commented code map

This file describes the current command handlers, shell command families, functions, and classes. Each entry explains what the item does and why it exists in the sync workflow.

## CLI commands

| Command | What it does | Important safety behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `init-config` | Writes the packaged commented TOML template. | Does not overwrite unless `--force` is used. |
| `test-source` | Verifies the configured source endpoint and source sudo commands. | In SSH mode it tests SSH first; in local mode SSH is skipped. |
| `test-ssh` | Alias for `test-source`. | Local mode skips SSH and checks the local source endpoint. |
| `list-source` | Lists source Timeshift snapshots. | Fast by default; `--verify-btrfs` performs slower UUID/read-only checks. |
| `sync` | Pulls/copies missing Timeshift Btrfs subvolumes. | Defaults can dry-run; real transfer requires run mode; incremental parents must match UUIDs. |
| `prune` | Applies destination retention rules. | Real deletion requires `--run --yes-delete`. |
| `create-manual` | Creates a source Timeshift on-demand snapshot. | Runs path preflight first; existing destination also requires UUID-confirmed source identity. |
| `show-state` | Prints local `state.json`. | Read-only; can show raw JSON with `--json`. |
| `clear-state` | Removes the configured state file after guarded confirmation. | Dry-run by default; real removal requires `--run`, `--i-understand-this-clears-state`, app lock acquisition, and two typed confirmations. It never deletes snapshots. |
| `delete-lock` | Removes the configured lock file only when it is stale. | Dry-run by default; real removal requires `--run`, `--i-understand-this-deletes-lock`, and two typed confirmations; it refuses an actively held lock. |
| `destroy-leftovers` | Destroys configured source send-cache/destination leftovers when retiring the app setup. | Dry-run by default; real deletion requires explicit target flag, `--run`, long danger flag, and two typed confirmations. It never deletes `source.snapshot_root`. |

## Source, destination, and helper commands

| Command family | What it does | Why it does it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ssh ... <source command>` | Runs source-side Timeshift and Btrfs commands on the configured SSH source when `source.mode = "ssh"`. | Keeps the destination-pull model: the backup machine controls the run and receives the stream. |
| `sh -c <source command>` | Runs the same source-side commands locally when `source.mode = "local"`. | Allows local sync without duplicating the sync engine or weakening the safety checks. |
| `sudo -n timeshift --list` | Lists source Timeshift snapshots, tags, comments, and snapshot names. | The app needs Timeshift metadata to decide what exists, what order to process snapshots in, and what retention tags apply. |
| `sudo -n timeshift --create --comments <text>` | Creates an optional source on-demand snapshot. | Lets a sync run start by capturing the current system state before the normal oldest-to-newest send loop. |
| `sudo -n btrfs subvolume show <path>` | Reads UUID, parent UUID, received UUID, and read-only state for a subvolume. Optional existence probes are quiet when missing; required checks still print/log stderr. | Incremental sends are only safe when source and destination Btrfs identities match, while not-yet-created cache paths such as `@home` should not look like real errors. |
| `sudo -n btrfs subvolume list ... <root>` | Builds source-cache and destination indexes of known subvolume paths and UUID metadata. | Reduces repeated metadata probes and helps cleanup find nested subvolumes safely. |
| `sudo -n btrfs subvolume create <path>` | Creates the source cache root or per-snapshot cache parent as a Btrfs subvolume. | Writable Timeshift snapshots need read-only send copies, and those copies must live inside Btrfs. |
| `sudo -n btrfs subvolume snapshot -r <src> <dst>` | Creates a read-only source-cache snapshot from a writable Timeshift snapshot child. | `btrfs send` requires the send source to be read-only. |
| `sudo -n btrfs send [-p <parent>] <current>` | Streams a full or incremental Btrfs snapshot from the chosen source path. | This is the actual payload transfer mechanism. Incremental mode saves time and space by sending only changes since the verified parent. |
| `sudo -n btrfs receive <destination folder>` | Receives the Btrfs stream into the destination snapshot folder. | Recreates the source snapshot subvolume on the backup filesystem. |
| `sudo -n btrfs subvolume delete <path>` | Deletes destination snapshots or app-owned source cache subvolumes during cleanup. | Btrfs subvolumes must be deleted with Btrfs, not ordinary `rm`. |
| `mbuffer` | Optional middle stage between `btrfs send` and `btrfs receive`. | Gives buffering, rate limiting, and transfer statistics when enabled. |
| `sudo -n btrfs subvolume create <helper path>` | First attempt for missing destination helper folders such as the lock/state/log or snapshots folder. | Prefer Btrfs subvolumes because the app manages Btrfs backup storage. |
| `mkdir` / `rmdir` / `rm -rf` | `mkdir` is the fallback for helper-folder creation when Btrfs creation is not possible; `rmdir` / `rm -rf` remove safe ordinary leftover directories when needed. | Helper paths can still be ordinary directories on non-Btrfs or user-writable locations, while Btrfs payload subvolumes are handled by Btrfs commands. |
| `unlink state_file` | Removes only the configured state metadata file during `clear-state`. | Lets a controlled recovery run rebuild state from exact Btrfs UUID matches without deleting snapshots. |
| `flock lock_file` + `unlink lock_file` | Checks that the configured lock file is not currently held, then removes it during `delete-lock`. | Allows stale lock cleanup without bypassing an active running job. |

| `timeshift_btrfs_sync/data/config.example.toml` | Packaged package-data config template used by `init-config`. | Keeps the example config available after normal install and PyInstaller packaging. The `data` path must remain a directory so import/package-data lookup works correctly. |

## Functions and classes

### `maintenance.py`

- `MaintenanceResult`: records the target file, existence, action, and whether a guarded maintenance command changed anything.
- `_confirm_or_raise()`: requires exact typed confirmation before real state or lock removal.
- `_safe_configured_file()`: validates that the configured target is a single file and not a broad cleanup path.
- `_looks_like_state_file()`: refuses to clear a custom state path unless it looks like a ts-btrfs state document.
- `_looks_like_lock_file()`: refuses to delete a lock target that does not look like the app's simple lock file.
- `_print_header()`: prints the shared warning block for guarded metadata maintenance.
- `_require_real_confirmation()`: enforces real-mode danger flags and typed confirmations.
- `clear_state_file()`: removes only the configured `state_file` after confirmation; the CLI runs it inside normal logging and acquires the app lock before calling it in real mode.
- `delete_lock_file()`: removes only the configured `lock_file` when `flock` proves no running process currently holds it; the CLI runs it inside normal logging so stale-lock cleanup is auditable.

### `models.py`

- `SubvolumeMeta`: metadata returned by `btrfs subvolume show`; stores UUID,
  parent UUID, received UUID, and read-only flag.
- `SnapshotMeta`: parsed Timeshift snapshot with name, created text, tags,
  comment, path, and subvolume metadata list.
- `SnapshotMeta.sort_key()`: sorts timestamp-named snapshots oldest-to-newest;
  falls back safely when a name is not a normal Timeshift timestamp.
- `tags_text()`: shared display helper; formats tags as `O H D W M` or `none`.

### `config.py`

- `ManualSnapshotConfig`: automatic source Timeshift on-demand snapshot settings.
- `SourceConfig`: source mode, Timeshift root, subvolume names, command paths,
  sudo prefix, cache root, and discovery/cache behavior. `mode` is `ssh` by
  default and may be `local` to run source commands on the same machine.
- `DestinationConfig`: destination root, snapshot folder, and receive behavior.
- `StreamConfig`: optional stream helper settings such as `mbuffer`.
- `StreamConfig.command()`: returns the configured stream helper argv or `None`.
- `RetentionConfig`: destination retention counts and pruning options.
- `RetentionConfig.counts_by_tag()`: maps native Timeshift tags `H/D/W/M/B/O` to
  configured keep counts.
- `AppConfig`: full validated config object passed through the app.
- `ConfigError`: raised when TOML is invalid or unsafe.
- `_table()`: validates that a TOML section is a table; avoids silently accepting
  wrong section types. Missing optional sections become empty tables.
- `_optional_str()`: reads optional strings while preserving current behavior for
  fields where non-strings are ignored rather than fatal.
- `_positive_int()`: validates positive integer settings.
- `_stripped()`: converts values to stripped strings for legacy-compatible fields.
- `_bool()`: reads booleans without accepting strings like `yes` or `no`.
- `_int()`: reads integer fields with explicit type checks.
- `_as_str()`: strict string reader for required string values.
- `_as_path()`: strict path reader built on `_as_str()`.
- `_as_bool()`: strict boolean reader used where wrong types must error.
- `_as_int()`: strict integer reader with optional minimum value.
- `_string_list()`: validates list-of-string config fields such as subvolumes.
- `_normalize_source_path()`: normalizes source-side POSIX paths so safety comparisons do not depend on trailing slashes or redundant components.
- `_source_path_is_same_or_under()`: checks whether a configured source path is the protected root or a descendant; used to refuse a cache root inside Timeshift-owned snapshot storage.
- `load_config()`: reads TOML, explicitly rejects the removed unsafe `source.allow_incremental_without_parent_match` key, builds dataclasses, validates `source.mode`, and
  validates SSH only when `source.mode = "ssh"`. In local mode, `[ssh]` may be
  omitted and a placeholder SSH config is kept only so shared code can safely access `config.ssh`.

### `ssh.py`

- `_is_relative_to()`: path containment helper used to reject shared temporary
  ControlPath locations without broad string matching.
- `validate_control_path_safety()`: verifies that SSH ControlMaster has an
  explicit absolute ControlPath. If the parent directory is missing, it creates
  it with owner-only permissions. Existing parents must be owned by the user
  running the app, private, and not under shared temporary storage.
- `SSHConfig`: immutable SSH connection/auth settings.
- `SSHConfig.target()`: returns the `user@host` or `host` target string.
- `SSHConfig.uses_password_auth()`: reports whether password/sshpass mode is
  configured.
- `SSHConfig._read_password()`: reads password text from either inline config or
  password file.
- `SSHConfig.environment()`: builds environment variables for password auth.
- `SSHConfig.base_command()`: builds the base `ssh`/`sshpass ssh` argv, including
  optional ControlMaster/ControlPersist connection reuse.
- `SSHRunner`: helper that owns an `SSHConfig` and remote command defaults.
- `SSHRunner.__init__()`: stores SSH config for later command building.
- `SSHRunner.command()`: wraps a source shell command in the configured SSH argv.
- `SSHRunner.run()`: executes a source shell command through SSH with the shared
  command runner.
- `SSHRunner.environment()`: exposes SSH password environment variables.
- `SSHRunner.test()`: runs a simple remote command to confirm SSH works.

### `source.py`

- `SourceRunner`: source command endpoint wrapper used by sync, prune, preflight,
  Timeshift helpers, Btrfs helpers, and destroy-leftovers.
- `SourceRunner.from_config()`: creates `mode="ssh"` with `SSHRunner` or
  `mode="local"` without SSH from validated config.
- `SourceRunner.uses_ssh`: true when source commands are executed through SSH.
- `SourceRunner.location`: returns `remote` for SSH or `local` for local mode;
  Btrfs metadata helpers use this label in error messages.
- `SourceRunner.display_location`: human-readable source endpoint label.
- `SourceRunner.command()`: builds argv for one source shell command. SSH mode
  returns `ssh ... <command>`; local mode returns `sh -c <command>`.
- `SourceRunner.run()`: runs one source command and captures stdout/stderr using
  either `SSHRunner.run()` or local `run_local()`.
- `SourceRunner.environment()`: returns SSH password environment variables when
  needed; local mode returns `None`.
- `SourceRunner.test()`: verifies the source endpoint. SSH mode tests SSH;
  local mode verifies that local shell execution works.

### `preflight.py`

- `PathPreflightError`: raised before on-demand creation or send/receive when a
  required configured root is unavailable.
- `PathCheck`: one path availability result for terminal reporting.
- `_normalize_source_path()`: normalizes source POSIX paths before containment checks and shell-script generation.
- `_source_path_is_same_or_under()`: prevents source cache creation inside the protected Timeshift snapshot root.
- `_shell_words()`: shell-quotes configured command-prefix words such as
  `sudo -n` for embedded POSIX shell scripts.
- `_btrfs_path_check_script()`: builds a small POSIX shell script that checks
  required paths with `btrfs subvolume list -o` instead of generic sudo
  filesystem commands.
- `_parse_path_check_output()`: parses structured path-check sentinel lines,
  including OK/FAIL details from creation attempts.
- `_source_snapshot_root_script()`: verifies the Timeshift-owned
  `source.snapshot_root` on the selected source endpoint. In SSH mode the check
  runs through the configured SSH/sshpass command; in local mode it runs
  locally. The path must already exist and may be an ordinary directory on a
  Btrfs filesystem. The check first tries `btrfs subvolume list -o`, then falls
  back to `btrfs filesystem df` for Btrfs versions/layouts that reject ordinary
  directories for subvolume listing. The app never creates or deletes this path,
  because Timeshift owns the original snapshots.
- `_cache_root_check_script()`: runs only after `source.snapshot_root` has been verified; verifies `source.cache_root` is already a Btrfs
  subvolume; in real-run mode, if it is missing and `create_readonly_cache =
  true`, it verifies the parent and creates the exact configured path with
  `btrfs subvolume create <cache_root>`. It refuses ordinary directories at
  `cache_root`.
- `_source_path_checks()`: runs the source snapshot-root and cache-root scripts
  through SSH or local source mode and turns their sentinel output into
  `PathCheck` objects.
- `_parent_of_path()`: returns the parent directory text used when checking whether an exact missing target can be created safely.
- `_local_btrfs_result()`: runs a local configured Btrfs command without raising so preflight can convert success/failure into one `PathCheck`.
- `_compact_process_error()`: reduces command stdout/stderr and return code to a concise path-check explanation.
- `_compact_os_error()`: converts local filesystem exceptions into concise preflight details.
- `_print_check_block()`: prints one readable preflight result block with location, path, status, and detail.
- `_raise_for_failed_checks()`: combines failed `PathCheck` objects into one hard `PathPreflightError` after all relevant checks are reported.
- `_local_target_path_check()`: verifies `destination.target_root`; in real-run
  mode, if it is missing and `destination.create_target_root = true`, it creates
  the exact target root as a Btrfs subvolume after verifying that the parent
  already exists and is Btrfs-accessible. Existing target roots must pass
  `btrfs subvolume show`; ordinary directories inside Btrfs are refused so the
  backup root cannot be misidentified as a valid app-owned subvolume.
- `_path_is_within()`: normalizes local paths and checks containment before lock/helper preparation crosses configured roots.
- `check_required_sync_paths()`: prints the sync path preflight and refuses to
  continue before manual snapshot creation or send/receive when a configured
  path cannot be verified or created.

### `commands.py`

- `CommandError`: exception containing command text, return code, stdout, stderr.

  without prompting.
- `quote_join()`: shell-quotes argv for readable logs.
- `remote_double_quote()`: quotes a source shell string for nested SSH commands.
- `_merged_env()`: merges optional command environment with the current process.
- `run_local()`: runs a normal local command, logs command/result, honors
  `log_stderr` / `mirror_stderr` for expected negative probes, and raises
  `CommandError` on required failures.
- `_start_pipeline_readers()`: starts tee threads from one stream-routing table.
- `_failed_stderr()`: combines captured stderr-like streams that belong in an
  error message after a failed pipeline.
- `_log_failed_streams()`: copies captured pipeline streams into `.err` only when
  the pipeline actually fails.
- `stream_pipeline()`: runs `<source btrfs send> | optional mbuffer | <local
  btrfs receive>`. It buffers normal Btrfs/mbuffer stderr because successful
  `btrfs send` writes status like `At subvol ...` to stderr. That status goes to
  `.btrfs`/`.mbuffer` during success and is copied to `.err` only if the
  pipeline fails.

### `remote_index.py`

- `BtrfsIndex`: short-lived path/UUID lookup table for one Btrfs root.
- `BtrfsIndex.add()`: stores one `SubvolumeMeta` by path, UUID, and received UUID.
- `BtrfsIndex.discard()`: removes one path and its UUID lookup entries after deletion.
- `BtrfsIndex.contains()`: checks if a path is indexed as a Btrfs subvolume.
- `BtrfsIndex.meta()`: returns indexed metadata for a path.
- `BtrfsIndex.child_paths()`: returns indexed descendants deepest-first.

- `_index_from_list_output()`: helper for constructing an index from list output.
- `_paths_from_list_output()`: parses path-only Btrfs list output, used by read-only detection.
- `_mark_readonly_from_list()`: marks indexed subvolumes read-only or writable from one `btrfs subvolume list -r` result.
- `build_local_btrfs_index()`: builds a local Btrfs index with bulk list commands instead of one `subvolume show` per child.
- `_remote_bulk_index_script()`: builds the single source shell script used to list UUID metadata and read-only paths below one source root in one SSH session.
- `build_source_btrfs_index()`: builds a source snapshot-root or cache-root index using either SSH mode or local mode through `SourceRunner`.
- `build_remote_btrfs_index()`: compatibility wrapper for SSH source indexes.

### `payload_stats.py`

- `PayloadTreeStats`: normalized count object for a source cache, direct-send
  state view, or destination tree. It separates raw subvolume totals from real
  `@`/`@home` payload entries.
- `PayloadTreeStats.total_payload`: number of normalized payload entries.
- `PayloadTreeStats.total_cache_payload`: number of source payload entries coming
  from app-owned source cache.
- `PayloadTreeStats.total_direct_payload`: number of source payload entries coming
  from protected direct Timeshift sends.
- `normalize_path()`: normalizes path strings before relative matching.
- `_relative_parts()`: returns path parts below a configured root, or `None` for outside paths.
- `_recount_payload()`: rebuilds per-subvolume counters from the normalized payload set.
- `_add_payload()`: recognizes paths ending in configured subvolume names such as `@` and `@home`.
- `source_send_cache_stats()`: classifies source cache paths into real payload subvolumes and helper/container subvolumes.
- `destination_payload_stats()`: classifies destination paths into received payload subvolumes.
- `direct_send_payload_stats()`: reads state only for reporting and counts protected Timeshift original direct-send entries as source-side payload; it does not make deletion decisions.
- `merge_source_payload_stats()`: combines app-owned source-cache payload with protected direct-send payload before comparison.
- `PayloadMatchStats`: comparison object for normalized source and destination payload sets.
- `PayloadMatchStats.source_only`: source payload entries not present on the destination.
- `PayloadMatchStats.destination_only`: destination payload entries not present on the source side.
- `PayloadMatchStats.ok`: true when normalized source and destination payload sets match.
- `compare_payloads()`: builds a `PayloadMatchStats` object.
- `_format_count_line()`: creates aligned text output lines.
- `render_payload_match()`: renders the `SOURCE / DESTINATION SNAPSHOT MATCH` block.

### `btrfs.py`

- `_clean_uuid()`: normalizes Btrfs `-` UUID output to `None`.
- `parse_subvolume_show()`: parses `btrfs subvolume show` into `SubvolumeMeta`.
- `remote_btrfs_cmd()`: builds source-side Btrfs argv with optional sudo. The name
  is kept for compatibility; local source mode can still reuse the command text.
- `local_btrfs_cmd()`: builds destination-side Btrfs argv with optional sudo.
- `get_subvolume_meta()`: shared metadata reader for local/remote metadata checks;
  avoids separate parser paths that could disagree and keeps optional
  `required=False` probes quiet when paths are expected to be absent.
- `source_get_subvolume_meta()`: reads source Btrfs metadata through `SourceRunner`;
  with `required=False`, missing cache paths such as a not-yet-created `@home`
  send-cache child return `None` without terminal/.err noise.
- `_validate_cache_snapshot_name()`: rejects unsafe cache snapshot names.
- `_validate_cache_subvolume_name()`: rejects unsafe cache child names.
- `readonly_cache_parent_path()`: path for one timestamp folder inside cache root.

- `_subvolume_list_paths()`: parses paths from `btrfs subvolume list -o`.
- `_cache_path_suffixes()`: computes allowed relative/absolute match suffixes.
- `_listed_cache_path_matches()`: checks a listed subvolume is the intended cache
  path, not a similarly named Timeshift path elsewhere.
- `source_list_child_subvolumes()`: lists existing child subvolumes below a source
  cache parent through SSH or local source mode.
- `source_cache_existing_paths()`: lists `source.cache_root` once and returns
  requested timestamp cache parent subvolumes that currently exist.

  returns nested `@`/`@home` cache children that actually exist.
- `source_cache_contains()`: tests if a specific source cache subvolume exists.
- `source_cache_is_empty()`: checks whether a source cache parent has any children left.
- `remote_list_child_subvolumes()`, `remote_cache_existing_paths()`,
  `remote_cache_existing_child_paths()`, `remote_cache_contains()`, and
  `remote_cache_is_empty()`: SSH compatibility wrappers around the source helpers.
- `cache_child_display_path()`: formats cache child paths for logs.
- `_source_refresh_cache_path()`: refreshes one source cache path in the optional
  per-run Btrfs index after cache-root/parent/snapshot creation or before
  deciding whether an existing cache snapshot can be reused.
- `_reuse_existing_cache_snapshot()`: checks one exact source-cache send path
  before creation. It reuses the path only when Btrfs proves it is an existing
  read-only subvolume and, when parent UUID metadata is available, that it was
  created from the requested original Timeshift subvolume. This prevents
  recreate attempts after interrupted runs or state recovery.
- `_reuse_existing_cache_snapshot.validate()`: nested identity check that refuses writable cache subvolumes or cache snapshots whose Parent UUID belongs to a different Timeshift original.
- `source_ensure_cache_root()`: lazily creates the configured `source.cache_root`
  as a Btrfs subvolume when cache is actually needed. It creates only the exact
  configured root, requires the parent to already exist, and refuses an existing
  ordinary directory at that path.
- `source_ensure_cache_parent()`: first ensures the top-level cache root exists
  as a Btrfs subvolume, then creates the timestamp cache parent if missing and
  updates the source cache index when one is supplied.
- `source_ensure_readonly_send_path()`: returns the original Timeshift path when
  indexed or probed metadata proves it is already read-only, otherwise creates/reuses
  an app-owned read-only cache snapshot for the current send.
- `source_delete_subvolume()`: deletes one source Btrfs subvolume through SSH or local source mode. For app-owned cache parents it can first remove only empty ordinary child directories with non-sudo `rmdir`, then run Btrfs deletion, so stale mountpoint directories do not require broad source sudo permissions.
- `source_send_cmd()`: builds the argv for `btrfs send`, including `-p` for
  incremental sends, wrapped through SSH or local source mode.
- `remote_ensure_cache_parent()`, `remote_ensure_readonly_send_path()`,
  `remote_delete_subvolume()`, and `remote_send_cmd()`: SSH compatibility wrappers.
- `path_is_same_or_under()`: normalized destructive-safety comparison used to identify the protected Timeshift root itself and every descendant.
- `path_is_under_cache()`: tells cleanup whether a path belongs to cache root.
- `local_receive_cmd()`: builds `btrfs receive` argv for the destination folder.
- `delete_local_subvolume()`: deletes a destination Btrfs subvolume.

- `timeshift_cmd()`: builds source-side Timeshift argv with optional sudo.
- `normalize_tags()`: keeps only native Timeshift tags `H/D/W/M/B/O`.
- `parse_timeshift_list()`: parses `timeshift --list` into snapshots while
  keeping tags/comment/path mutable.
- `list_source_snapshots()`: runs Timeshift through `SourceRunner`, parses the
  result, and fills configured subvolume metadata from the bulk snapshot-root
  index before falling back to individual Btrfs probes when verification is enabled.
- `list_remote_snapshots()`: compatibility wrapper for SSH source listing.
- `create_remote_manual_snapshot_cmd()`: builds `timeshift --create --comments`.
- `create_source_manual_snapshot()`: runs manual creation through `SourceRunner`.
  It intentionally does not pass explicit `--tags O` because Timeshift on-demand
  snapshots are already tag `O`, and some versions reject explicit `--tags O`.
- `create_remote_manual_snapshot()`: compatibility wrapper for SSH manual creation.

### `state.py`

- `empty_state()`: creates a new state object.
- `_safe_relative_path()`: rejects paths that would escape the target root.
- `destination_path_to_relative()`: stores destination paths relative to
  `destination.target_root` so the whole backup root can be moved safely.
- `resolve_destination_path()`: resolves relative state paths under current
  target root.
- `normalize_destination_paths()`: normalizes absolute destination paths into
  safe relative paths on load.
- `load_state()`: reads JSON state or creates empty state, then normalizes paths.
- `save_state()`: atomically writes pretty JSON state.
- `refresh_snapshot_metadata_from_source()`: updates only mutable Timeshift
  metadata: `tags`, `comment`, `created`, and `path`. It must not touch UUID,
  send path, destination path, parent, or status fields.
- `snapshot_is_synced()`: returns whether all expected subvolumes are marked ok.
- `mark_subvolume_synced()`: records successful receive metadata after a transfer,
  including whether the exact `send_path` is app-owned source cache or a
  protected read-only Timeshift original.
- `send_path_kind_for_state_subvolume()`: returns the stored/fallback ownership kind.
- `state_send_path_is_app_cache()`: true only for app-owned send-cache paths that prune may delete.
- `state_send_path_is_protected_timeshift_original()`: true for direct read-only Timeshift original send paths that prune must never delete.
- `reject_protected_source_snapshot_path()`: final source-delete safety guard; refuses any source-side delete, prune, destroy, or cleanup attempt aimed at `source.snapshot_root` or anything below it.
- `remove_snapshot_from_state()`: removes a snapshot after successful pruning.
- `refresh_state_metadata_and_report()`: shared sync/prune helper that refreshes
  mutable metadata, reports changed snapshot names, and saves only when allowed.
- `latest_synced_before()`: finds the newest older synced parent candidate,
  including saved send-cache parents when the original Timeshift snapshot was pruned.

### `sync.py`

- `SyncError`: fatal sync safety/logic error.
- `_local_meta()`: reads destination Btrfs metadata through the shared parser.
- `_source_meta()`: reads source Btrfs metadata, preferring bulk snapshot/cache indexes before falling back to a targeted `subvolume show`.
- `_human_blank()`: prints a blank line in human-readable summaries.
- `_human_rule()`: prints section dividers for terminal/log summaries.
- `_record_sync_event()`: adds one sync/full/incremental/skipped event to the run
  summary without changing state.
- `_print_sync_summary()`: writes the readable `SYNC SUMMARY` to terminal and `.succes`.

- `list_source_snapshots()`: runs Timeshift source discovery and uses the bulk source snapshot-root index to avoid one SSH `subvolume show` per configured subvolume.
- `source_snapshot_index()`: builds a name-to-snapshot dict for the current source list stage.
- `confirm_source_identity_before_manual_snapshot()`: shared source identity guard
  for automatic and standalone manual snapshot creation. Empty destinations may
  create a first full seed; non-empty destinations require a UUID-confirmed anchor.
- `_is_app_manual_snapshot()`: identifies source Timeshift tag `O` snapshots whose
  comment contains `manual_snapshot.marker`.
- `_pending_app_manual_snapshots()`: finds existing app-created on-demand snapshots
  that are not fully synced yet, so retry runs keep them in normal order.
- `_verify_sync_viability_before_manual_snapshot()`: proves the current
  source/destination chain can continue before changing the source by creating
  a new Timeshift snapshot. It checks a UUID-confirmed sync floor and a usable
  incremental parent for the next pending transfer, or for a future manual
  snapshot when nothing is currently pending.
- `_verify_sync_viability_before_manual_snapshot.verify_parent_for()`: nested wrapper that runs strict parent selection for one pending/future subvolume and rewrites failures with manual-snapshot context before any source snapshot is created.
- `_maybe_create_manual_snapshot()`: optionally creates a Timeshift manual
  snapshot only after preflight, state recovery, source identity, and sync
  viability checks have proven it is safe to change the source. It still
  preserves older pending app-created snapshots in the send queue.
- `_snapshots_in_sync_order()`: sorts source snapshots oldest-to-newest.
- `_select_initial_sync_snapshots()`: on a fresh destination, applies the retention
  planner and selects only snapshots that would be kept.
- `print_snapshot_table()`: displays source snapshots and tags.
- `_dest_subvolume_path()`: destination path for one received subvolume.
- `_target_snapshot_dir()`: destination path for one snapshot folder.
- `_destination_has_existing_snapshots()`: records whether destination snapshots existed at run start. That run-start result fixes full-seed permission for the whole transaction, so later recovery cleanup cannot turn an existing backup into a new seed.
- `_snapshot_destination_paths_exist()`: verifies expected destination paths before skipping a state-complete snapshot.
- `_preview_send_path()`: predicts direct read-only send versus cache use during dry-run previews.
- `_send_path_kind_text()`: explains whether the selected send path is protected Timeshift original or app-owned cache.
- `_ensure_source_send_path()`: verifies/creates the current read-only send path
  through `SourceRunner`.
- `_cleanup_incomplete_destination_receive()`: removes only the current partial
  destination receive before retry and invalidates the destination index entry.
- `_source_cache_live_child_paths()`: performs a fresh Btrfs child-subvolume list below one source send-cache date parent for recovery cleanup, converting listed paths back under `source.cache_root` before any delete is allowed.
- `_cleanup_source_cache_snapshot_version()`: removes the app-owned `source.cache_root/<snapshot>` recovery version, deleting live child cache subvolumes deepest-first and then the date parent, while still refusing any Timeshift-owned source path.
- `_remove_empty_destination_dirs_up_to()`: removes empty ordinary destination directories upward without crossing the configured stop root.
- `_cleanup_destination_snapshot_version()`: removes one failed destination `snapshots/<date>` version as a whole, deleting Btrfs subvolumes and empty dirs only so `@` and `@home` cannot be mixed from different transfer attempts.
- `_refresh_snapshot_source_subvolumes_live()`: targeted live-probes every configured source subvolume for one Timeshift date and updates the per-run source snapshot index so stale hourly entries are not trusted.
- `_snapshot_destination_has_any_path()`: detects whether a destination date has any current folder or configured child path that recovery may need to clean.
- `_snapshot_state_is_complete_with_destination()`: checks that both state and destination contain all configured subvolumes before treating a snapshot as complete.
- `_recover_snapshot_version()`: central sync recovery reporter/dispatcher that cleans source cache, destination, and state for a failed or vanished current snapshot date and refreshes metadata indexes.
- `_prepare_snapshot_for_transfer_or_recover()`: snapshot-level pre-transfer guard that verifies all configured source subvolumes still exist; if the source still exists it clears a failed current version for retry, and if the source vanished it removes stale traces and skips that date.
- `_recover_stale_state_snapshots_missing_from_source()`: start-of-run cleanup for stale incomplete state entries whose Timeshift source snapshot is no longer listed.
- `_read_local_destination_parent_metadata()`: reads metadata for a candidate destination parent.
- `_match_source_path_to_destination_received_uuid()`: compares source path UUID to destination `received_uuid`; this is the core incremental identity rule.
- `_select_verified_parent_send_path()`: chooses a safe source parent for incremental send. It first tries an indexed source-cache subvolume whose UUID matches the destination parent's `Received UUID`, then the saved `send_path`, then indexed cache paths for UUIDs stored in state, and finally the original Timeshift path. It never recreates a missing parent cache snapshot because recreated cache snapshots get new UUIDs.
- `_select_verified_parent_send_path.add_candidate()`: nested deduplication helper that records each possible parent path only once while preserving safest-first order.
- `_state_uuid_values_for_path()`: returns trusted UUID values remembered for a state path.
- `_state_uuid_values_for_path.add_key()`: nested state-reader helper that adds one non-empty UUID field to the allowed identity set.
- `_find_confirmed_sync_floor()`: finds a safe high-watermark after pruning by confirming source/destination UUID history.
- `_filesystem_parent_candidates()`: finds older candidates present in both source and state.
- `_destination_snapshot_names()`: lists destination snapshot folders oldest-to-newest for state recovery.
- `_expected_original_source_path()`: builds the expected Timeshift-owned source path for a snapshot/subvolume without creating it.
- `_source_cache_meta_by_uuid()`: finds an existing source-cache subvolume by exact UUID and refreshes its metadata so recovery can prove read-only cache identity.
- `_match_existing_destination_to_source()`: compares one existing destination subvolume's `Received UUID` with the matching source Timeshift subvolume and source-cache index. It returns a send path only for exact UUID matches.
- `_recover_state_from_existing_destination()`: rebuilds missing or empty state from already-existing destination snapshots. It adopts only exact UUID matches and refuses to treat unadopted existing destination paths as incomplete receives.
- `_select_parent()`: chooses full seed or a verified incremental parent. Full sends
  are allowed only when the destination was empty at run start. It never re-checks
  current emptiness after recovery cleanup, so a temporarily emptied existing target
  cannot become a new full-send chain. Without a usable UUID match it raises a clear
  source/destination mismatch error.
- `sync_once.discover_source_index()`: nested discovery helper that prints the selected verification mode and rebuilds the Timeshift name index before and after optional manual snapshot creation.
- `sync_once()`: complete sync transaction for one config/run. It creates the
  `SourceRunner`, skips SSH tests in local mode, runs preflight, discovers source
  snapshots, and conservatively recovers missing state when possible. If the
  destination was populated at run start, it must prove a complete UUID-confirmed
  source/destination anchor before stale or partial snapshot recovery may delete
  anything. It then proves manual-snapshot viability, sends/receives data, writes
  state, and optionally prunes.

- `_delete_live_source_cache_children()`: deletes any remaining live child subvolumes below one cache parent deepest-first before the parent is deleted, even when the run-start cache index or state thought `@`/`@home` were already gone.
- `source_snapshot_state()`: builds temporary state-like data from the source Timeshift list so fresh/full sync can reuse the retention planner.
- `initial_sync_keep_names()`: returns retained source snapshot names for a fresh destination seed.
- `_cleanup_source_cache_for_pruned_snapshot()`: checks one timestamp send-cache parent, deletes tracked app-owned cache subvolumes, performs a final live child-subvolume check below the parent, and deletes the parent only after Btrfs reports no remaining child subvolumes.
- `build_prune_plan()`: computes retention keep/delete decisions from state, source tags, and config; it does not delete anything.
- `_delete_destination_snapshot_for_prune()`: deletes destination Btrfs subvolumes for one snapshot and returns true only when destination paths are confirmed gone or already absent.

### `destroy.py`

- `DestroyResult`: summary object for one destructive cleanup root.
- `DestroyResult.success`: true when a target has no cleanup errors.
- `_safe_cleanup_path()`: refuses relative paths, `/`, and broad system roots before any destructive delete.
- `_listed_path_to_absolute()`: converts Btrfs `subvolume list` relative paths back to absolute paths below the configured root.
- `_is_under()`: verifies a candidate path stays inside the selected cleanup root.
- `_sort_deepest_first()`: orders subvolumes deepest-first so child subvolumes are deleted before parents.
- `_collect_recursive_subvolumes()`: walks Btrfs child subvolumes one level at a time so nested cache children are found before deleting the timestamp parent.
- `_run_quiet()`: runs cleanup probes/deletes quietly on the terminal while recording the command, return code, stdout, and stderr in the active run logs.
- `_run_source_quiet()`: runs quiet source-side cleanup commands through `SourceRunner`.

- `_delete_local_tree()`: recursively discovers and deletes local child subvolumes deepest-first, then removes stale ordinary directories/files.
- `_source_delete_subvolumes_batched()`: deletes many source-cache subvolumes in one source command during `destroy-leftovers`, removing empty ordinary child directories before parent deletion without requiring sudo `rm`, `find`, `chmod`, or `chown`.
- `_delete_source_tree()`: checks the source send-cache root with configured sudo+Btrfs metadata before falling back to normal shell visibility, recursively walks `btrfs subvolume list -o` from each discovered cache subvolume, deletes nested payload subvolumes such as `@` before timestamp/container parents, and keeps `source.snapshot_root` protected.
- `_mode_text()`: returns the exact typed phrase for the chosen destructive mode.
- `_print_target()`: prints one configured cleanup root before any deletion.

- `_print_payload_match_if_available()`: prints the normalized source/destination payload match block when both source cache and destination target were selected.
- `destroy_leftovers()`: main retirement cleanup entry point. It ignores retention/state by design, prints progress before each source/destination target, and attempts source/destination targets independently so one failing side does not prevent the other side from being cleaned.

### `preflight.py`

- `PathPreflightError`: hard error raised before snapshot creation, transfer, lock creation, or helper-folder writes when a required path cannot be verified or created.
- `PathCheck`: one path preflight result containing label, path, location, status, and explanation.
- `ensure_local_helper_dir()`: accepts an existing writable helper directory or Btrfs subvolume; when missing, it tries exact-path `btrfs subvolume create` first and falls back to exact-path mkdir if Btrfs creation is not possible, then verifies the app user can write inside the helper path.
- `prepare_lock_path()`: prepares the lock-file parent before any other real sync/prune path checks, then `FileLock` opens the lock file. If the lock path chain includes destination.target_root, that component is created with the strict target-root Btrfs subvolume rule; other missing lock-path components try Btrfs subvolume creation first and then mkdir fallback.
- `prepare_destination_helper_paths()`: verifies/creates `snapshots/`, `state_file.parent`, `lock_file.parent`, and optional `log_dir` before state writes or receives.
- `check_required_sync_paths()`: verifies/creates source snapshot/cache roots and destination.target_root before on-demand snapshot creation or send/receive work.

### `lock.py`

- `FileLock`: context manager for one lock file.
- `FileLock.__init__()`: stores the lock path.
- `FileLock.__enter__()`: opens/acquires the already-prepared lock file non-blocking. It no longer creates parent directories itself, because lock path preflight must create the parent safely as either a directory or Btrfs subvolume before locking.
- `FileLock.__exit__()`: unlocks and closes the lock file.

## Combined source inventory and source-change continuation

### `remote_index.py`

- `SourceInventory`: groups one Timeshift list, the complete `source.snapshot_root` Btrfs index, and the complete optional `source.cache_root` Btrfs index from the same inventory generation. It exists so parent/source comparisons do not mix metadata captured by separately timed SSH sessions.
- `SourceInventory.snapshot_names`: extracts sorted Timeshift timestamp names for inventory-difference reporting.
- `SourceInventory.meta()`: resolves a source path from the cache index first and then the Timeshift snapshot index; this gives recovery and parent checks one lookup interface for both roots.
- `_parse_remote_btrfs_index_result()`: parses one marked bulk-index section into `BtrfsIndex`. The standalone one-root builder and the combined source inventory share it so UUID, Received UUID, Parent UUID, read-only, missing-root, and error behavior remain identical.
- `_remote_source_inventory_script()`: builds the single source shell command that runs Timeshift listing and both bulk Btrfs root scans. In SSH mode it is deliberately wrapped by one SSH invocation to reduce authentication and network round trips.
- `_split_remote_source_inventory_output()`: separates the marked Timeshift, snapshot-root, and cache-root output sections without confusing normal command output with protocol markers.
- `build_source_inventory()`: creates one coherent `SourceInventory`. SSH mode uses one source/SSH command for all source views; local mode uses the same parsers and safety rules without network overhead.
- `describe_source_inventory_changes()`: produces terminal/log descriptions of added/removed Timeshift names, added/removed Btrfs paths, UUID/read-only identity changes, and root availability changes between two inventory generations.
- `compare_index()`: nested helper inside `describe_source_inventory_changes()` that compares one named Btrfs root and explains path or identity differences.

### `preflight.py`

- `_combined_source_path_check_script()`: wraps snapshot-root and cache-root preflight scripts into one source command. It runs the cache check only after the snapshot-root output contains its explicit OK marker, preserving the rule that app-owned cache storage cannot be created or modified when the Timeshift-owned root is unsafe.

### `btrfs.py`

- `_source_create_readonly_cache_snapshot()`: creates a read-only send-cache snapshot and immediately reads its Btrfs metadata inside one source command/SSH session. It verifies read-only state and available Parent UUID identity before returning metadata for the in-memory cache index.

### `sync.py`

- `_snapshots_from_source_inventory()`: converts the Timeshift part of a coherent source inventory into `SnapshotMeta` objects while filling configured children from the already loaded snapshot-root index.
- `_required_pipeline_source_changes()`: compares only paths required by a failed operation—current source/send path, selected incremental parent, and optional sibling paths—and reports disappearance or UUID replacement. This prevents unrelated Timeshift churn from hiding a network, mbuffer, receive, permission, or destination failure.
- `load_source_inventory()`: nested `sync_once()` helper that builds one combined source inventory, prints why the generation was needed, and returns the parsed Timeshift snapshot mapping.
- `build_snapshot_queue()`: nested `sync_once()` helper that rebuilds the current oldest-to-newest queue from the latest source inventory while preserving explicit snapshot selection, fresh-destination retention selection, and existing-destination ordering rules.
- `recover_from_source_inventory_change()`: nested `sync_once()` helper used after proven source identity changes during preparation or send/receive. It enforces the per-item retry limit, reports inventory differences, removes obsolete in-run accounting, cleans the incomplete whole snapshot date from app-owned cache/destination/state, rebuilds the combined inventory and queue, and continues without weakening UUID parent safety.
